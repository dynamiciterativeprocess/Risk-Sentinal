# Risk-Sentinal: Quantitative Risk Management Course Notes

Welcome to the repository for my DataCamp course notes on Quantitative Risk Management! This repository contains comprehensive notes, code snippets, and resources from the course to help you understand and apply quantitative techniques in risk management.

## Course Overview
Quantitative risk management is an essential aspect of modern finance and business operations. This course covers various quantitative methods used to measure, analyse, and manage risk in financial markets and beyond. From probability theory to advanced risk modeling techniques, you will gain a solid foundation in quantitative risk management principles.

   - Types of risk
   - Importance of risk management

2. **Probability Theory for Risk Management**
   - Probability distributions
   - Expected value and variance
   - Probability density functions

3. **Statistical Methods for Risk Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Correlation and covariance
   - Hypothesis testing

4. **Value at Risk (VaR)**
   - Definition and interpretation
   - Parametric VaR
   - Historical simulation VaR

5. **Expected Shortfall (ES)**
   - Concept of ES
   - Calculation methods
   - Comparison with VaR

6. **Risk Models**
   - Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
   - Multifactor models
   - Credit risk models

7. **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**
   - Basics of EVT
   - Applications in risk management
   - Tail risk estimation

8. **Stress Testing**
